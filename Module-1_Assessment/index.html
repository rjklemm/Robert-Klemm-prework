                    Hello. My name is Bob Klemm and I am from Wisconsin. A little bit about myself: I graduated from college with a Bachelors of Science in Physics. I grew up in a small town, but went to college in a big city. I enjoy swimming, running, and playing piano and guitar. I also really enjoy spending time with friends.
                    I also spend free time listening to music. I also do different types of puzzles. Right now, I enjoy doing crosswords. I believe that I am a continuous learner.

                <p>
                    Besides learning CSS and HTML right now, I also know some Python and MATLAB. These languages have allowed me to practice using some of my mathematics and physics knowledge from my undergraduate years.

                    I hope that you enjoy looking at this website as much as I enjoyed creating it. I am interested in learning more programming languages. This has been a great way to learn web development and practice my new skills.
